This is a **Ticket Management Application** built with **Next.js** and **MongoDB**. It allows users to create, view, update, and delete tickets related to hardware, software, and project issues. The app provides a user-friendly interface to track ticket priority, progress, status, and category.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chriswebofficial/Ticket-Management.git
   cd ticket-management-app
   ```

## Install dependencies:

npm install

# or

yarn install

## Create a .env file in the root with your MongoDB URI:

MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/ticket

## Run the development server:

npm run dev

# or

yarn dev

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to start using the app.

## Project Structure Overview

/app
/api
/Tickets # API routes for ticket CRUD operations
/(Components)
TicketCard.js
TicketForm.js
Nav.js
/page.js # Main dashboard displaying tickets
/lib
db.js # MongoDB connection setup
/(Models)
Ticket.js # Mongoose schema and model

## How It Works â€” Flowchart

User opens the app (Dashboard)
|
v
Fetch tickets from API -> Display tickets grouped by category
|
v
User clicks "Create Ticket" -> Fill form -> Submit
|
v
POST new ticket to API -> Save in MongoDB
|
v
API returns success -> UI refreshes -> New ticket appears
|
v
User can:

- Delete ticket (calls DELETE API)
- Update progress/status (calls PATCH API - if implemented)
  |
  v
  UI updates accordingly

## Future Improvements

Add user authentication and authorization.

Enable editing of existing tickets.

Implement ticket comments or chat.

Add notifications for ticket updates.

Enhance UI with more animations and better accessibility.
